## About
### Hi! My name is Stephanie Li
I'm currently studying <b>Chemical Engineering</b> at the <b>University of Waterloo</b>.
I enjoy applying my knowledge on research projects to change the world one day. I completed my first co-op at <b>Environment and Climate Change Canada</b>,
where I worked as a Lab Assistant in the Air Quality Research Division. I analyzed air samples from our 26 field measurement sites across Canada for 
concentrations of specific ions, nitrates, and sulfates. This research is used for air quality models and predictions.

I also love creating, designing, and researching new ideas! I've developed an interest in learning and using Figma
in the <b>University of Waterloo's Midnight Sun Solar Car Team</b> as the Strategy Team's UI/UX lead.
I'm also passionate about biological processes and learning more about developments in biochemical engineering.
In my free time, I also enjoy playing french horn in my university's music ensembles and jamming to my favourite classical pieces.
I look forward to developing my technical skills and using my creativity, problem-solving, and love for learning to develop new technologies that will benefit society.
